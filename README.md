## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The client, W. Avy, inquired additional information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, was requested in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

Summary statistics reflecting June and December temperatures were generated into a Data Frame using Python and Pandas. The two tables below demonstrate the following conclusions:

 - There is a 4 degree difference on average between month of June (75) and the month of December (71), and June being just slightly warmer compared to December. 

 - Looking at the minimum temperatures, there is about 8 degree difference between the month of June(64) and the month of December(56). 

 - As far as maximum temperatures, there is only a difference of 2 degrees between the month of June(85) and the month of December(83).

## Summary:

Based on the data from the summary statistics for the month of June and December, we can anticipate that W. Avy can keep the shop open year round. There is only a 2 degree difference in the maximum temperature and 8 degree difference in the minimum temperature between the two months. Most importantly, is that the average temperature is almost the same, so we can extrapolate that most of the year the temperature is between 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheight which can provide a stable customer base for surfing and ice cream purchases. 

Additional data that would be helpful in determining profitability and sustainability of the business throughout the year is to run a competitor comparative analysis of the similar areas that offer surfing and ice cream. Additionally, an analysis of precipitation can be ran based on the three year trend data, so that W. Avy can run a predictability scale to be ready for possible revenue loss during typical heavy rain months of days.
